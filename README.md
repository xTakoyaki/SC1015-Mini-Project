## About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence). We aim to focus on making predictions on how GDP affects the standard of living of a country, measured by various factors such as Human Development Index (HDI) and Happiness Index (HI).

We have picked out two datasets from Kaggle that will accompany us in our journey to make these predictions:

1.[Human Development Index Historical data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elmartini/human-development-index-historical-data)<br>
2.[World Happiness Report](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness)

## Problem Statement
Given the following factors:<br>
* GDP
* Standard of Living
   * Human Development Index
   * Happiness Index

## Notebooks in our Project

## Conclusion
* The model has a high explained variance range of 0.8 - 0.9 and low mean square error spanning from 0.01 - 0.03 hence it is both accurate and precise.
* Standard of living is multifaceted which makes predicting it difficult, especially by just using two datasets.
* Our model will be able to give a good idea of how GDP per capita is affected by HDI and HI. 
* Ideally, we hope that we had more dataset to train the model.

## New things learnt
* Transformation of DataFrames in Pandas (e.g., conversion of categorical to numeric values)
* Combining and filtering different datasets
* Using MLR modelling
* Concept of collinearity
* New library: Plotly (3D Scatterplot)
* How to professionally use Github
