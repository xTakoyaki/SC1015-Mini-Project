## About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence). We aim to focus on making predictions on how GDP affects the standard of living of a country, measured by various factors such as Human Development Index (HDI) and Happiness Index (HI).

We have picked out two datasets from Kaggle that will accompany us in our journey to make these predictions:

1.[Human Development Index Historical data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elmartini/human-development-index-historical-data)<br>
2.[World Happiness Report](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness)

## Problem Statement
Given the following factors:<br>
* GDP
* Standard of Living
   * Human Development Index
   * Happiness Index

## Conclusion
* The model attains a final evaluative score of 
* Although the model may not be able to accurately predict …., it gives a possible idea of…...
* Standard of living is multifaceted which makes predicted it hard 
* Perhaps the model should not be used to attempt to accurately predict black’s first move; rather, to see what other players would do in the same situation.


## New things learnt
* Transformation of DataFrames in Pandas (e.g., conversion of categorical to numeric values)
* Combining and filtering different datasets
* Using MLR modelling
* Concept of collinearity
* New library: Plotly (Chloropleth map)
* How to professionally use Github
