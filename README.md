## About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence). We aim to focus on making predictions on how GDP affects the standard of living of a country, measured by various factors such as Human Development Index (HDI) and Happiness Index (HI).

We have picked out three datasets from Kaggle that will accompany us in our journey to make these predictions:

> 1.[World GDP(GDP, GDP per capita, and annual growths)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zgrcemta/world-gdpgdp-gdp-per-capita-and-annual-growths)<br>
2.[Human Development Index Historical data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elmartini/human-development-index-historical-data)<br>
3.[World Happiness Report](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness)
